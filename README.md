- 👋 Hi, I’m @almaskhanwazir
I am a software engineering graduate who is seeking to ﬁnd the opportunity to work in a fun and challenging working environment that will encourage me to improve and learn new and necessary skills as well as be motivated by the company to do
my best for the sake of helping myself and the company advance in the software engineering industry.

I love web development and Information technology, which is why i start working in this field after high school. I have about 18 months of experience in full-stack development on very complex projects with very senior developers. I worked on different back-end technologies, front-end, test automation scripts, deployment, agile development, CI and CD, and much more.
i was responsible for all my code, from writing to deployment and writing tests for my tasks that were completed by me.
I have a problem-solving attitude so bring on your problems, and I will get them fixed. As a Mensa member, I am able to add on new needed skills and knowledge very quickly. I can adopt new technologies quickly.
