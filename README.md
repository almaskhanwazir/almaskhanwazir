Experienced software Engineer proficient in many platforms and tools, focused on delivering business value through quality software. I am equally comfortable discussing requirements in the language of the business as I am in heads-down coding sprints. I can take hard problems from conception to production, designing the big picture and sweating the details. A lively debater around the planning table and a passionate, agile collaborator, I understand that the team succeeds together. I love creating distributed systems, prototyping with new technology, and automating the tedious. I have an intellectual curiosity that fuels a fanatical devotion to skills improvement and constant learning. I also have a talent for leading technical projects, driving initiatives, and keeping all the balls in the air.
